errai-polymer
=============
Web Components usher in a new era of web development based on encapsulated and interoperable custom elements that extend HTML itself. Built atop these new standards, Polymer makes it easier and faster to create anything from a button to a complete application across desktop, mobile, and beyond.

==Polymer core elements
Polymer's core elements are a set of visual and non-visual utility elements. They include elements for working with layout, user input, selection, and scaffolding apps.

==Polymer paper elements
Polymer's paper elements collection implements material design for the web. They're a set of highly visual, highly interactive elements that include things like controls, layouts, hero transitions, and scrolling effects.

Errai-polymer allows Errai-UI templates and Errai-DataBinding to utilize polymer web components in a manner that is simple and seamless.
